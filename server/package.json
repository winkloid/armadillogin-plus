Also, users will be able to login on another device using an Mobile-to-Web authentication mechanism (showing an QR code on one device, scan it with another one and login on the other device to create a authenticated session on the first device). Maybe there will also be an eID feature later that will allow users to also login via an eID service to create an credential.",
